# Super Bowl 54 Score Prediction Using Machine Learning
# Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost


### Linear Regression Prediction: 25-23 Chiefs Win
### Linear Regression with Weather Data Included: 29-28 49ers Win
### Random Forest Prediction: 38-25 Chiefs Win
### XGBoost Model Prediction: 31-26 Chiefs Win
### Ensemble Model Composite Prediction: 28-26 Chiefs Win  
### FINAL SCORE
### Kansas City Chiefs - 31 
### San Francisco 49ers - 20

### Ultimately, the models can be scored by calculating the distance between the predicted score value minus the actual final score value. XGBoost is #1 followed by linear regression. 
* Linear Regression was off by 9 points
* The Linear Regression with Weather was off by 12 points
* THe Random Forest was off by 12 points
* XGBoost 6 points


# This project underscored the importance of deep contextual understanding (domain knowledge), wrangling data in Python to process datasets for insights, and applying multiple machine learning models.
